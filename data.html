          <h3 class="data1H3">Group Processes</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">Retrospectively, working as a group went exceptionally well for UMI and we felt that the entire team contributed equally and consistently during Assignment 2. We were pleasantly surprised to observe that the team's commitment, motivation, and participation throughout the project was consistently high, which afforded the team peace of mind and confidence in one another.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">This observation is especially true considering the majority of the team initially entered the collaborative environment with apprehensions about the possibility of workload disparities, confrontations and roadblocks. These assumptions were due to previous encounters with substandard teamwork experiences. We were fortunate enough to find ourselves in a group of self-starters, all of whom demonstrated a fair disposition and an openness to suggestions and constructive criticism.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">While our group worked exceptionally well together, we still identified areas for improvement moving forward and we have strived to integrate the learnings from these experiences into Assignment 3. These areas of improvement include more structure around individual deadlines - we often found the agreed upon due dates were generally not adhered to, making subsequent meetings lengthier and more discussion required around how individuals were tracking. The team implemented harder deadlines to mitigate this issue, enabling a more transparent overview of progress and allowing more time to collaborate across various tasks. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Additionally, we learned that our quality control processes were far less efficient than intended, with excessive editing required to ensure the written elements of the assignment were palatable for readers of all technical understanding and to achieve a consistent tone of voice across the project. To reduce this load, the team devised an improved QC process that required more stringent checks of one's individual work preceding QC submission. With a few added steps marked off using a templated checklist, we aimed to prevent the rewriting of significant segments and free up the quality controller's time for more technical tasks. Subsequently, QC editing was focused primarily on minor spelling and grammar issues, plus some minor tweaks to maintain continuity of tone. Additionally, multiple team members were introduced to the QC process to prevent the inundation of work to any one team member.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">We also concluded that more contribution from the entire team to GitHub would provide greater insight into our progress along the way. We found that we failed to form this habit in the early stages of Assignment 2, which was frequently overlooked or left to one team member. Consequently, the team emphasised the importance of GitHub and committed to utilising it more frequently to generate an audit trail of our work. </p>

          <h3 class="data1H3">Career Plans</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">As covered in Assignment 2, our ideal jobs and career plans fall into two distinct categories and based on our continued experience and feedback, we stand by our initial comparison and analysis as per our previous assignment. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The first of these categories includes career plans that centre on engineering and developmental roles. The ideal jobs we selected that fell into this category include Software Engineer, Automation Software Engineer and App Developer. The second category encapsulates roles distinguished by leadership and seniority. The ideal positions that fell into this category were Strategic Technology Lead, Chief Technology Officer and Project Manager.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The career plans within their corresponding category share numerous similarities whilst also differentiating from those in the opposing group. The below visual matrix demonstrates this dichotomy and the shared attributes between each position.</p>
          <img class="matrix" src="Images/matrix.png" alt="matrix" width="750" height="200">
          <p class="mainTextData">As detailed in the matrix, there are clear intersects in both soft and hard skills. This data highlights the significance of skill sets that are perhaps less often regarded when considering a career in IT, such as relationship-building, communication, and organisational skills. Also notable is the experience required across these positions, with most requiring a substantial incumbency in a similar role.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Overall, our ideal jobs continue to have more in common than they differ, particularly within their respective category. Whilst half of our chosen career paths are distinct from the other, our career progression and outlook remain closely intertwined. As we found in Assignment 2, this represents an excellent opportunity to foster advantageous connections as graduates and excel in our chosen positions.</p>

          <h3 class="data1H3">Tools</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">Considering our success with the tools used in Assignment 2, and the need to maintain maximum efficiency, the team utilised the same core tools for Assignment 3. These core tools remain using GitHub to house all artefacts, including the report, website, wireframes, mockups, and documents to take better advantage of its audit trail in this stage of the project. Despite committing to adopting GitHub more, the team observed that this process was less ideal than alternatives such as Google Docs, Google Drive and Trello, which proved to be more intuitive and suited to our needs. We struggled to discern ways in which GitHub was more advantageous than other tools and technology but speculated this viewpoint would swing if we were to enter into the developmental stage of the project scope. Overall, we were satisfied with the tools relied upon throughout Assignment 2 and 3.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The continuation of Google Docs for collaborative, real-time report contributions was valuable, particularly given the conflicting nature of our schedules. The ability to review and monitor other's progress without the need to establish a call or meeting was helpful and highlighted areas to raise during our scheduled meetings. We upheld Microsoft Teams as the primary means of communication; however, we would more than likely look to Slack as a more comprehensive and integrated option in the future.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">We also continued our Trello workflow into Assignment 3, favouring it for it's transparency, usability, effortless collaboration and clear activity log. The checklists were particularly beneficial to the quality control process, and due dates helped manage and meet impending deadlines with transparent accountability.
          Additionally, we introduced a suite of new systems and tools to facilitate the production of prototypes and other artefacts to contextualise the report. We elected Figma as our primary interface design, wire-framing and prototyping tool, chosen for its ubiquity in the UI/UX field, its collaborative capability, the ability to export markup and other programming logic to developers for visual elements, the embed feature, and its overall intuitive design interface. Figma enabled us to create professional-quality mockups and live prototypes that we considered crucial to our business funding endeavours, being a start-up requiring capital investment. Visualising our application and demonstrating its functionality served as a vehicle to convey its value and describe the user journey to stakeholders.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">To achieve prevailing project management best practices, the team also introduced Monday to the mix. We discussed replacing Trello entirely with Monday; however, after weighing the limited scope and timeframe of the project, we identified the risk of setbacks occurring if we were to dedicate working hours to learning Monday's Kanban view. Subsequently, we introduced Monday as a supplementary platform to Trello and utilised its Gantt Chart view to maintain an overview of the project schedule, plot dependencies, track milestones, and divide the project into weekly sprints. Ordinarily, we would utilise the two-way integrations available between Trello and Monday to solve for cross platform use and automate some of the manual steps involved, however, we were limited by the costs associated with upgrading our accounts to accommodate this. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The team recognised Monday as a superior tool to Trello and concluded that projects should be consolidated into this platform in the future.</p>

          <h3 class="data1H3">Reflection</h3>
          <h6 class="reflectionTitles">Daniel Blake</h6>
          <p class="mainTextData">In this second assignment, I was impressed by how much most group members learned from the first group assignment. In the last attempt, we left work far too late for the assignment. Late work caused problems with editing, and things were left very late. However, the group completed work early on this occasion, and stress levels were much lower heading into the final week.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">I think that working on too many systems of storage caused a little confusion. Having a google doc, separate google storage space, and GitHub may have been somewhat inefficient.  Also, I do believe that some members' contributions were a little late in arriving. Late arriving work made it somewhat harder to coordinate a congruent piece of work in the end.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">I was pleasantly surprised by the effort put in by our group leader into researching and implementing agile project management practices. This structured approach made the team function on a much more efficient level. Also, sprints kept everyone informed of team expectations and enabled positive task tracking.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">In groups, it pays to have an in-depth plan. Our group benefited from using project planning tools, such as a Gannt chart, Trello, and sprints, which made the combined effort a lot easier. The tracking enabled a significant improvement on the first assignment. I also learned that it pays to try and understand the human element. I made the mistake of criticising people unprofessionally, which I regret, as the team works much better when treating members with respect.</p>

          <h6 class="reflectionTitles">Nicholas Drinkwater</h6>
          <p class="mainTextData">Coming off the success of Assignment Two, I had high hopes and expectations that the team would be able to not only continue with but improve upon the work that we produced for the previous assignment. Despite these high expectations I had set, I was still surprised at the team’s ability to work even harder in this assignment and the team’s willingness to fully take on board the feedback that we collated and received following Assignment 2. Throughout this assignment, it constantly felt as though the entire team was endeavouring to produce the best work that they could and I’m extremely grateful that I’ve been able to work with this group. Especially, I was impressed with the deadlines that we were able to set ourselves and stick to, to ensure that work was being submitted in a timely matter and not left until close to the last minute.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Whilst the team has improved in so many areas, we could continue to work on ensuring that the work is evenly divided between group members and that visibility is provided to everyone in the group about what is being worked on. As the assignment progressed and work was assigned, there was times where no work in progress or update was visible for certain tasks and whilst it is necessary to delegate the tasks required, an overall picture of the project was at times hard to discern due to this.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">In my Assignment 2 reflection, I mentioned that I was hesitant to work within groups due to the horror stories about group work that you hear, where work is left for just one or two group members to complete. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this wasn’t the case and throughout both Assignment 2 and 3, I’ve learned that working in a group doesn’t have to be a negative thing. Finding the right group to work with, I’ve found that the work that you can produce is of a much higher standard than if you were to work by yourself. By being a part of UMI, it makes me look forward to other group projects as I continue through my studies. Whilst I’m sure there will be times where group work doesn’t go the right way, being a part of this group has given me a new outlook and motivation for working in groups in the future.</p>

          <h6 class="reflectionTitles">Abby Durbridge</h6>
          <p class="mainTextData">Having established strong team morale and connections during Assessment 2, progressing onto Assessment 3 became a much easier endeavour due to open communication channels and a better grasp of the team's strengths/weaknesses. Once again, each team member leaned into their strengths and offered to take on the tasks most suited to them. I was thoroughly impressed and grateful to the leadership team who demonstrated mature project and people management skills. The team, under great leadership, continued to improve our time management and produce content much more timely.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Though working in a remote function, I do feel there was more collaborative work across the board to contribute towards the assignment’s artefacts. Whether members were able to meet in person or break the tasks up in manageable parts to contribute to one whole section.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Overall, the level of work produced for this tertiary assignment was phenomenal and undoubtedly helped prepare me for not only future units but also the workforce. The areas I would consider need further development, should we embark as a company towards full product completion, are aligning our values and our why behind the brand UMI. Having the advantage of the original project idea and writing the motivations section, I felt a deeper connection behind the project’s why.</p>

          <h6 class="reflectionTitles">Mathew Dwyer</h6>
          <p class="mainTextData">I was extremely pleasantly surprised at how well we did on assignment 2, so it seemed our teamwork had paid off. While we weren't quite as organised as we could have been, what we did have had worked quite well regardless.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">This time around, our organisation was much better, meaning we were able to make much more effective use of time. Everyone in the group contributed well and helped all other group members when needed.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Having had mostly bad experiences working in groups previously, I have been very happy working within this one, with everyone being open to suggestions and criticism, communicating often and effectively, and any inter-team conflict resolved quickly and without any bad blood.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The biggest take away I have from this team is the importance of having clear goals for each individual so that everyone can be confident that each team member is contributing towards the group's overall goal in a meaningful way. It is also the importance of constant open communication so if anyone feels like they are falling behind, they are not afraid to let others know and ask for help.</p>

          <h6 class="reflectionTitles">Erin Paton</h6>
          <p class="mainTextData">Reflecting on Assessment Three, I can confidently say that most of the bottlenecks and areas for improvement experienced during Assessment Two were effectively mitigated. UMI's organisational and communication skills were already strong, however, the team has demonstrated clear growth in these areas with the addition of new tools and communication protocols introduced from the outset. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">We initiated Assessment Three with a video meeting to discuss our feedback and to openly communicate areas we each felt needed refinement to avoid conflict, setbacks, and undue double-handling that the team had previously observed. As a result, we agreed upon adopting an Agile Methodology and producing work in pre-planned weekly Sprints in order to maintain stricter deadlines. We integrated Monday's Gantt board into our existing workflows and by plotting interdependencies between tasks, we were able to maintain unspoken, transparent accountability.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">During Assessment Two, the team experienced significant double-handling of tasks due partly to individuals working offline which permitted virtually no transparency on progress and ownership, and partly due to my inadequate Quality Control protocol. Moving into Assessment Three, the QC process was improved by providing the team with the resources needed to effectively check their own work for unintentional plagiarism, spelling errors, word count and rubric issues before submitting to QC. This refinement reduced my workload considerably during Assessment Three, freeing up my time for more technical tasks.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Additionally, a new method of ownership was introduced that assigned team leads in their field of expertise whom the team would assemble around to complete tasks, with the idea that they had someone skilled to lean on and subsequently learn from. I can't speak for the rest of the team, but I found this approach invaluable as I found I was absorbing information incidentally through the collaborative process.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Overall, Assessment Three felt much smoother and less stressful than Assessment Two and I would attribute that to the team's willingness and enthusiasm to ameliorate, their tolerance for constructive criticism and their dedication to achieving the best possible result.</p>

          <h6 class="reflectionTitles">Harrison Tang</h6>
          <p class="mainTextData">After completing Assessment Two and beginning work on Assessment Three, the group collectively decided to improve on certain factors that would enhance collaboration and revision of works done by group members. These improvements would include harder deadlines to submit and display work, regular communications around work progression and collaborative opportunities, and better use of GitHub and project management tools.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">With the assessment brief calling for more in-depth detailing of our project idea, UMI Translation, we were able to contribute to each other’s delegated tasks more closely and effectively than in Assignment Two. Tracking progression of our GitHub website, artefacts, and deliverables was made easier due to excellent work-flow management and consistent use of project management tools, while we consistently adhered to a bi-weekly schedule of group meetings to discuss work progress and ideas. Each group member was able to contribute a unique element to the project in line with their strengths, skills, and superior knowledge across particular fields, while collaboration on assessment elements was observed more frequently due to the more focussed nature of the assessment brief and the content produced.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Because of the unique challenges of studying and collaborating online and through management programs such as Microsoft Teams, not all project processes proceed as planned. Overall, improvements to communications and more regular insight into progress made on tasks would provide everyone with a stronger understanding of the intricate details of the overall project, which would lead to stronger collaboration on ideas, research, and direction. With this in mind, more even delegation of tasks may lead to more collaborative work and provide a more rounded learning experience, although this is nit-picking the details at this stage.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">What surprised me in this experience was how open communications between group members were. The commitment shown by group members to produce their highest quality of work has been humbling and inspiring. To have effective and profound collaboration over university assessment between peoples living hundreds to thousands of kilometres apart shows how powerful modern technological advancements have become.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">I have learned that forming groups is a powerful tool for sharing and enhancing ideas. People from various backgrounds are able to connect over a somewhat buggy, limited platform to produce a beautiful report and website about a translation application. Over the course of the last nine or so weeks, I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know my fellow group members, and I intend to continue connecting with them over the course of our university studies.</p>

          <h6 class="reflectionTitles">Group</h6>
          <p class="mainTextData">Following the feedback from Assessment 2, and considering our own personal experiences throughout the project, the team committed to identifying and improving upon areas that caused bottlenecks and setbacks with open and honest communication. We did so by initiating a video meeting in which we examined the Assessment 3 spec and rubric through the lens of our tutor and group feedback. We subsequently spitballed ways to solve for problems that had arisen previously and established more stricture around our deadlines and processes going forward. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Reflecting back as a group, the ability to critique our own and others work with candour set the tone for Assessment 3. We found vast improvements in our collaborative efforts, our communication, our adherence to deadlines and the unwavering commitment to produce work of the highest quality we could reasonably attain. In particular, the documentation of the overall project scope from the outset and the introduction of new organisational tools, such as Monday, fostered a tension-free environment. Previously, we’d experienced ebbs and flows of high-stress periods where the team felt unorganised, flustered or behind schedule and the lack of planning and structure amplified this. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Collectively, the team echoed similar sentiments regarding the experience throughout Assessment 3. The steady pace of the work was more manageable with the deliverables being granulated. This created more room to breathe and for individuals to produce work in more reasonable blocks. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Moving forward, a fairer system for delineation of tasks would contribute to a more rounded learning experience, where group members can be better exposed to unfamiliar platforms and processes to aid them in their learning. Large tasks can be identified and broken down into smaller tasks to mitigate work overload and more evenly distribute work and contributions. Additionally, collective demonstrations of work produced would provide a deeper insight into project details and more opportunities for collective contributions and opportunities for collaboration. Instances of this occurred during group meetings where group members showcased their work through the platforms they were working on and were extremely helpful in better understanding details of the overall project and the tools and technologies involved.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Group work is a powerful tool for the development of ideas by drawing the talents of many people to produce a single project. We learned creating a positive and open environment, coupled with excellent project management skills and consistent communication, can lead to producing some of our best work. Despite this being our final project together for Introduction to Information Technology, each team member displayed drive and enthusiasm for their work, and for the project. We should be extremely proud of our collective efforts.</p>
