          <h3 class="data1H3">Ideal Job</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">At the outset of our assignment, we each individually listed five core skills that are required for our ideal jobs. We have then used these five core skills along with the Burning Glass Industry Data to compare and contrast these skills and the ideal jobs that we have selected through the graph below:</p>
          <img class = "matrix" src="Images/matrix.png" alt="matrix" width="750" height="200">
          <p class="mainTextData">As the graph demonstrates, the general skill requirements (represented in blue) for all six of our ideal jobs are closely in common. Whilst general skills such as communication and time management are widely regarded as required for most jobs, they especially important in the IT field. As the Burning Glass data illustrates, these qualities rank very highly in demand.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Surprisingly, we found that our ideal jobs segmented into two key categories: leadership or seniority, which represented three of our ideal roles, and engineering and development, representing the remaining three. These findings are apparent across both hard and soft skillsets as demonstrated in the above graph. This trend continues throughout the IT-specific skillset, with all leadership roles requiring the same skills, which is also reflected across all ideal engineering/development jobs.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The data shows an intersect between our ideal jobs, and the ability for them to be divided into the two primary categories mentioned above. Where the differences come into play is in the amount of experience required across our jobs. Four out of six selected jobs require prior experience in similar roles, with the timeframe of this experience ranging from two years to up to 10 years. The core skills that we identified through our ideal job listings also range from being very specific, such as requiring at least two years of software engineering experience, to quite ambiguous, such as a general knowledge of multiple programming languages with no set amount of experience detailed.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Overall, the ideal jobs that we have selected have more in common than they have differences. With our ideal jobs being split in half between management/seniority and software engineering, our individual career progression and outlook are closely intertwined. This represents an excellent opportunity to foster advantageous connections as graduates.</p>

          <h3 class="data1H3">Tools</h3>
          <h3 class="data2H3">What We've Done</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">From the outset of our assignment, we wanted to ensure that we could track and maintain all of our objectives and the output that was produced. We therefore set up a group GitHub to house all artefacts created, such as our report and website. We opted to use Google Docs to work on our report, which enabled us to work collaboratively and monitor contributions in real-time. Using a collaborative platform rather than a Word file removed the need to continually download documents and upload them to GitHub whenever changes were made. To track these changes, we uploaded a Word file version of the Google Doc to GitHub periodically.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">We used Microsoft Teams extensively for all of our group communication and meetings. Kanban was chosen as the most effective collaborative framework to track each individual's work and we opted for Trello to effectuate this, which has proven invaluable for our team, particularly due to its integration with MS Teams. Trello is a workflow tool that manages project tasks into a visual board. This enabled us to set appropriate deadlines for each job to be completed with transparency around each team members progress. Our workflow, broken down into columns, transpired as follows; To-Do, In Progress, Staging, Ready for Production, Completed. Each task had a designated card that was assigned an owner. The card would then visibly make its way through the workflow in real-time. Once a card reached completion, its content was committed to the website and the final report.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Additionally, UMI utilised Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard, to facilitate brainstorming for our project idea.</p>
          <h3 class="data2H3">GitHub Audit Trail Discussion</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">Due to the extensive use of Google Docs, Trello and MS Teams, our GitHub practice did tend to fall by the wayside for most of the assignment. GitHub became more of a backup and place for safekeeping of the work. The team relied on the applications mentioned above and technologies where we could see iterative and evolving changes. With that being said, reviewing the insights of our GitHub usage shows that we only had 2 authors on the GitHub page, who have pushed 16 commits to main and 16 commits to all branches. 12 files have changed throughout our assignment, and there have been 738 additions and 127 deletions, with the main bulk of these additions and deletions related to the HTML, CSS and Javascript used in our group website.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">As we have continually updated changes that we have made in the Google Doc in addition to the website code to GitHub, we do approach an accurate portrayal and journey of the work completed by the team. However, due to only have two authors, there is room for the team to improve in the usage of GitHub.</p>

          <h3 class="data1H3">Industry Data</h3>
          <h3 class="data2H3">Our Ideal Jobs</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">Our six job titles cover a wide range of different occupations within the IT field, encompassing different sets of skills and experience. Our six job titles are: </p>
          <ul class = "dataList">
            <li>Strategic Technology Lead</li>
            <li>Software Engineer </li>
            <li>Chief Technology Officer</li>
            <li>Automation Software Engineer</li>
            <li>Project Manager</li>
            <li>App Developer</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mainTextData">Using the data provided of the top occupations, software engineers and developers are the most highly in demand, with this demand more than double the following position. This data illustrates that three out of six of our ideal jobs, which represents half, are within the highest in-demand occupations, which presents an excellent opportunity for half of our team to find roles within this field due to the demand in this sector. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">With three of our ideal jobs remaining, the next highest in-demand is the IT Manager role which covers two of the remaining ideal jobs (Project Manager and Chief Technology Officer). Rankings 10th, these roles still represent substantial opportunities being in the top 50% of in-demand roles. Our last ideal job ranks 16th as Technology Consultant, which encapsulates Strategic Technology Lead.</p>

          <h3 class="data2H3">Skills Required</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">With half of our team's ideal jobs being software engineers/developers and the other half of our team being positions of leadership and seniority, our required skill set ranks highly in demand for our IT-specific skills and general skills. Below, we’ve identified a set of skills required for all six of our ideal jobs divided accordingly:</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">General Skills</p>
          <ul class = "dataList">
            <li>Communication - The highest in demand and the foremost reoccurring requirement across all six positions.</li>
            <li>Problem-solving - The second highest in demand skill, required across all positions.</li>
            <li>Organisational skills - The third highest in demand, required in particular for the project manager and leadership roles.</li>
            <li>Teamwork/Collaboration - The fifth highest in demand and very closely tied to communication skills, every job that we’ve selected requires the ability to work in a team and collaborate effectively.</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting - The sixth highest in demand, crucial for people in engineering/development roles.</li>
            <li>Planning - The seventh highest in demand. Tied to organisational skills, this ability is essential in project lead and leadership roles.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mainTextData">IT-Specific Skills</p>
          <ul class = "dataList">
            <li>JavaScript - The second highest IT-specific skill and programming language, only one ideal job specifically mentions this language.</li>
            <li>Java - The third highest in demand and the only programming language encompassed in all three of our ideal jobs related to software engineering.</li>
            <li>Project Management - The fifth highest in demand and the one IT-specific skill applicable to all positions with aspects of project management applied in most IT jobs.</li>
            <li>Business Management - The seventh highest in demand, this IT-specific skill is important for our ideal jobs that are related to positions of leadership and management.</li>
            <li>Technical Support - The eleventh highest in demand, this is the broadest of the IT-specific skills that relate to our ideal jobs.</li>
            <li>Software Engineering - The fifteenth highest in demand, at least half of our ideal jobs contain aspects of software engineering as a core requirement.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="data2H3">Skills Ranking</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">UMI's IT-specific and general skills rank highly in demand as a whole across all six of our ideal jobs. As three of these positions are focused on software engineering and development, the IT-specific skills related to these jobs were highly ranked, such as JavaScript, Java and Technical Support. The three remaining jobs were leadership and management positions and therefore required project management and business management skills; these too ranked highly in terms of industry demand.</p>

          <h3 class="data2H3">General Skills - Not in Required Skill Set</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">As our team has an eclectic set of ideal jobs, many of the highest in-demand skills of a general nature are covered at least once. With some of the remaining required skills being quite broad and ambiguous, it can be hard to discern whether a general skill is within our required skill set. For example, leadership skills would likely encapsulate organisational skills.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The three highest-ranked general skills that the burning glass data does not explicitly mention are organisational skills, writing, and detail-oriented skills. </p>

          <h3 class="data2H3">IT-Specific Skills - Not in Required Skill Set</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">Contrary to general skills, which can be broad and ambiguous, the IT-specific skills are much more specific and technical, meaning it’s easier to identify the three highest-ranked IT skills that are not a requirement for UMI's ideal jobs. These skills are SQL, which ranks as the highest in-demand skill; Microsoft Windows, which can be considered an essential skill in this day and age but not required for our listed jobs; and SAP, which ranks as the sixth most in-demand skill not needed in any of our ideal jobs.</p>

          <h3 class="data2H3">Opinion</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">After reviewing the Burning Glass data, it’s been both surprising and welcoming seeing all six of our ideal jobs ranking highly in demand in multiple different skills, both in the IT-specific category as well as the general skills category. This data has served to fortify our original decisions and inspire confidence to continue to strive towards attaining these positions in the future.</p>
