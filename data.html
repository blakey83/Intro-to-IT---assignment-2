          <h3 class="data1H3">Group Processes</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">Retrospectively, working as a group went exceptionally well for UMI and we felt that the entire team contributed equally and consistently during Assignment 2. We were pleasantly surprised to observe that the team's commitment, motivation, and participation throughout the project was consistently high, which afforded the team peace of mind and confidence in one another.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">This observation is especially true considering the majority of the team initially entered the collaborative environment with apprehensions about the possibility of workload disparities, confrontations and roadblocks. These assumptions were due to previous encounters with substandard teamwork experiences. We were fortunate enough to find ourselves in a group of self-starters, all of whom demonstrated a fair disposition and an openness to suggestions and constructive criticism.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">While our group worked exceptionally well together, we still identified areas for improvement moving forward and we have strived to integrate the learnings from these experiences into Assignment 3. These areas of improvement include more structure around individual deadlines - we often found the agreed upon due dates were generally not adhered to, making subsequent meetings more lengthy and more discussion required around how individuals were tracking. The team implemented harder deadlines to mitigate this issue, enabling a more transparent overview of progress and allowing more time to collaborate across various tasks. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Additionally, we learned that our quality control processes were far less efficient than intended, with excessive editing required to ensure the written elements of the assignment were palatable for readers of all technical understanding and to achieve a consistent tone of voice across the project. To reduce this load, the team devised an improved QC process that required more stringent checks of one's individual work preceding QC submission. With a few added steps marked off using a templated checklist, we aimed to prevent the rewriting of significant segments and free up the quality controller's time for more technical tasks. Subsequently, QC editing was focused primarily on minor spelling and grammar issues, plus some minor tweaks to maintain continuity of tone. Additionally, multiple team members were introduced to the QC process to prevent the inundation of work to any one team member.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">We also concluded that more contribution from the entire team to GitHub would provide greater insight into our progress along the way. We found that we failed to form this habit in the early stages of Assignment 2, which was frequently overlooked or left to one team member. Consequently, the team emphasised the importance of GitHub and committed to utilising it more frequently to generate an audit trail of our work. </p>

          <h3 class="data1H3">Career Plans</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">As covered in Assignment 2, our ideal jobs and career plans fall into two distinct categories and based on our continued experience and feedback, we stand by our initial comparison and analysis as per our previous assignment. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The first of these categories includes career plans that centre on engineering and developmental roles. The ideal jobs we selected that fell into this category include Software Engineer, Automation Software Engineer and App Developer. The second category encapsulates roles distinguished by leadership and seniority. The ideal positions that fell into this category were Strategic Technology Lead, Chief Technology Officer and Project Manager.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The career plans within their corresponding category share numerous similarities whilst also differentiating from those in the opposing group. The below visual matrix demonstrates this dichotomy and the shared attributes between each position.</p>
          <img class="matrix" src="Images/matrix.png" alt="matrix" width="750" height="200">
          <p class="mainTextData">As detailed in the matrix, there are clear intersects in both soft and hard skills. This data highlights the significance of skill sets that are perhaps less often regarded when considering a career in IT, such as relationship-building, communication, and organisational skills. Also notable is the experience required across these positions, with most requiring a substantial incumbency in a similar role.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">Overall, our ideal jobs continue to have more in common than they differ, particularly within their respective category. Whilst half of our chosen career paths are distinct from the other, our career progression and outlook remain closely intertwined. As we found in Assignment 2, this represents an excellent opportunity to foster advantageous connections as graduates and excel in our chosen positions.</p>

          <h3 class="data1H3">Tools</h3>
          <p class="mainTextData">Considering our success with the tools used in Assignment 2, and the need to maintain maximum efficiency, the team utilised the same core tools for Assignment 3. These core tools remain using GitHub to house all artefacts, including the report, website, wireframes, mockups, and documents to take better advantage of its audit trail in this stage of the project. Despite committing to adopting GitHub more, the team observed that this process was less ideal than alternatives such as Google Docs, Google Drive and Trello, which proved to be more intuitive and suited to our needs. We struggled to discern ways in which GitHub was more advantageous than other tools and technology but speculated this viewpoint would swing if we were to enter into the developmental stage of the project scope. Overall, we were satisfied with the tools relied upon throughout Assignment 2 and 3.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The continuation of Google Docs for collaborative, real-time report contributions was valuable, particularly given the conflicting nature of our schedules. The ability to review and monitor other's progress without the need to establish a call or meeting was helpful and highlighted areas to raise during our scheduled meetings. We upheld Microsoft Teams as the primary means of communication; however, we would more than likely look to Slack as a more comprehensive and integrated option in the future.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">We also continued our Trello workflow into Assignment 3, favouring it for it's transparency, usability, effortless collaboration and clear activity log. The checklists were particularly beneficial to the quality control process, and due dates helped manage and meet impending deadlines with transparent accountability.
          Additionally, we introduced a suite of new systems and tools to facilitate the production of prototypes and other artefacts to contextualise the report. We elected Figma as our primary interface design, wire-framing and prototyping tool, chosen for its ubiquity in the UI/UX field, its collaborative capability, the ability to export markup and other programming logic to developers for visual elements, the embed feature, and its overall intuitive design interface. Figma enabled us to create professional-quality mockups and live prototypes that we considered crucial to our business funding endeavours, being a start-up requiring capital investment. Visualising our application and demonstrating its functionality served as a vehicle to convey its value and describe the user journey to stakeholders.</p>
          <p class="mainTextData">To achieve prevailing project management best practices, the team also introduced Monday to the mix. We discussed replacing Trello entirely with Monday; however, after weighing the limited scope and timeframe of the project, we identified the risk of setbacks occurring if we were to dedicate working hours to learning Monday's Kanban view. Subsequently, we introduced Monday as a supplementary platform to Trello and utilised its Gantt Chart view to maintain an overview of the project schedule, plot dependencies, track milestones, and divide the project into weekly sprints. Ordinarily, we would utilise the two-way integrations available between Trello and Monday to solve for cross platform use and automate some of the manual steps involved, however, we were limited by the costs associated with upgrading our accounts to accommodate this. </p>
          <p class="mainTextData">The team recognised Monday as a superior tool to Trello and concluded that projects should be consolidated into this platform in the future.</p>
